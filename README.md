# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition

This repository is a follow along with the book by [Brain W. Kernighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie).

## Introduction

1. C is a general purpose programming language. It is closely assosiated with UNIX.

2. C inherits many ideas from BCPL, developed by Martin Richards and B by Ken Thompson.
  * While B and BCPL are typeless languages, C is not. C has characters, integers, and floating points.

3. There are also derived data types created with pointers, arrays, structures, and unions. 
  * Pointers allow for address arithmetic.

4. Expressions are formed operators and operands.
  * Any expression including assignment or a function call can be a statement.

5. C provides fundamental control-flow:
  1. if-else
  2. switch
  3. while, for
  4. do
  5. break

6. Functions:
  * Can return basic types, structures, unions, or pointers.
  * Can be called recursively.
  * Cannot be nested.
  * Variables can be declared in block-structed fashion.
  * Can exist in seperate source files.

7. C is a "Low Level Language".

8. C provides no operations to deal directly with composite objects:
  * Strings, sets, lists, or arrays
  * However most implementations come with basic libraries for these.

9. C was redifined by the ANSI in 1983.
